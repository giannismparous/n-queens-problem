# N Queens Problem with Hill Climbing

## Objective
The objective of this project was to develop an AI algorithm in order to be able to solve the well known N Queens Problem in acceptable time. The algorithm we used is Hill Climbing with restarts. The reason we use this variation of the Hill Climbing algorithm is because we don't to be able to escape from the local maximums.
